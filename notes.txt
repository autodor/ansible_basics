three servers - provision servers, vs doing manual work. automate everything <-- ansibles job.
ansible control host == ansible server. connects to servers in fleet to issue commands to provision.
ansible is only in control host and issue ssh commands

control host / managing server will store scripts. git repo can also contain playbooks
